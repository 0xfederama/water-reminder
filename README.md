# Water Reminder

:droplet: :droplet: :droplet:

Remember to drink every 20 minutes with this simple script.

You have to install [go](https://golang.org/doc/install) in order to use the app. You can avoid to install go only if MacOS is still in develpment

### Installation

##### Linux

- Clone the repository in the place you want
- If MacOs is still in develolment, you can jump to the next step. Otherwise, open a terminal, write `cd path/to/water-reminder` and use `go build drink.go`
- Open "Startup Applications", press "Add" and in the command section write `path/to/water-reminder/drink`. Give the app the name you want.
- If you don't want the app to open at startup, just go in the terminal and execute it with `/path/to/water-reminder/drink`


##### MacOS
- Sorry, still developing it
